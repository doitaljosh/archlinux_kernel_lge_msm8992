# archlinux_kernel_lge_msm8992

WHAT IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED:

- Virtual Terminal
- Multiple devpts instances
- Ralink USB WiFi drivers (rt2800usb, etc)
- Enhanced control group support among other systemd-specific options
- bcmdhd firmware/configs relocated to /lib/firmware
- Auto mount devtmpfs
- SysV IPC
- PID, NET, IPC, UTS namespaces
- USB Gadget Serial
- Framebuffer console/tux logo drivers enabled

TODO LIST:

- Modularize the MSM KGSL graphics driver as it doesn't play well with FBCON.
- Backport freedreno MSM DRM/KMS driver.
- Full systemd init system support
- Most other things need to be done in the userland.
- If possible, develop a working mainline kernel for this lovely device.

KNOWN BUGS:

- If user namespace is enabled, strict UID/GID checking is also enabled which breaks compilation with a long series of errors about 'kuid_t'.
- FBCON driver conflicts with KGSL when compiled as a module. Causes kernel panic when modprobed.
- Using systemd as init results in 'Kernel Panic: not syncing. Attempted to kill init!'
